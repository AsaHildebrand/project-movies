# Project Movies

The assignment for this week was to creat a multipage-application by using the API to fetch data.

## The problem

We started with set up a base by coding a long with the lectures. Then we got it to work with our API. We had some problem with fetching the data from the second endpoint, but we got help from a team mate to realise that we used the wrong state. We had some problems with some of the 
styling but got help at Stack Overflow and from our team mates. If we have had more time we would have make animations on the button and added more pages.
